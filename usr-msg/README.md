Hi!

This folder is empty for a reason.

This folder stores messages from servers, and therefore it would 
not be a good idea to have those messages tracked in git.

Therefore, this is the only message that exists in here that you could see.

Please move along. There is nothing else to see here.

Thank you.




















































































































































































































Are you serious? 

There is nothing to see here. 

You really want something to be here though. 

Hmm.. Ok fine. Go join my bot testing server.

It's dead tho, and the bot isn't on often, but you wanted something!
